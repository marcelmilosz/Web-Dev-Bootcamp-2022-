# Web-Dev-Bootcamp-2022 

This project is a finishing project of Udemy course that I took. 

I took me about 2 months to finish (I've tried to spend about 2-3 hours every day [This course is 64 hours long]). 
It was awesome and gave me some new and fresh knowledge to continue my web dev journey :) 


To create this project I used: 
- HTML
- CSS (Mainly Bootstrap 4 & 5) 
- JS (Node, Express, Npm)
- MongoDb (Cloudinary to host images) + Mongo Atlas
- AJAX & JSON 
- Mapbox api
- Bunch of different npm modules 
- Session and cookies

Things that you can do at this website:
- Login 
- Sign In (with Cookies, Session, Joi and Passport)
- Add new "Campground" 
- Leave a review (Star rating) 
- Edit and Delete "Campground" 
[This site also have a ton of security and Error handling stuff..]

Final project is hosted on Heroku:
